# Examples

Get started with these examples that demonstrate key functionalities of PyKale.

Naming convention: `data_method` or `problem_method`.

## Separate data and code

All data in examples are from the public domain so they will be downloaded into local directories, either automatically or following instructions in specific examples. To keep this repository size small, we do not upload data here unless the size is less than 300KB. This is done by setting `.gitignore`. Data can be shared at [PyKale Data Repository](https://github.com/pykale/data) or other external locations, e.g., Google Drive.
