    """
    Generates pandas dataframe with summary statistics.
    Designed for use in Quantile Binning (/pykale/examples/landmark_uncertainty/main.py).

    Args:
        results_dictionary (dict): A dictionary containing results for each quantile bin and uncertainty method.
            The keys are strings indicating the name of each uncertainty method.
            The values are dictionaries containing results for each quantile bin.
        cols_to_save (list): A list of 2-element lists, each containing a string indicating the key in the
            results_dictionary and a string indicating the name to use for that column in the output dataframe.
        sheet_name (str): The name of the sheet to create in the output Excel file.
        save_location (str): The file path and name to use for the output Excel file.
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A dataframe with statistics including mean error, std error of All and individual
        targets. Also includes the Sucess detection rates (SDR).
        The dataframe should have the following structure:
            df = {
                "All um col_save_name Mean": value,
                "All um col_save_name Std": value,

    Save a dictionary to an Excel file using the XlsxWriter engine.

    Args:
        data_dict (Dict[Any, Any]): The dictionary that needs to be saved to an Excel file. The keys represent the row
                                    index and the values represent the data in the row. If a dictionary value is a list
                                    or a series, each element in the list/series will be a column in the row.

        save_location (str): The location where the Excel file will be saved. This should include the full path and the
                            filename, for example, "/path/to/save/data.xlsx". Overwrites the file if it already exists.

        sheet_name (str): The name of the sheet where the dictionary will be saved in the Excel file.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return anything. It saves the dictionary as an Excel file at the specified location.
