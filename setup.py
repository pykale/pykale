# Dependencies with options for different user needs. If updating this, you may need to update docs/requirements.txt too.
# If option names are changed, you need to update the installation guide at docs/source/installation.md respectively.
# Not all have a min-version specified, which is not uncommon. Specify when known or necessary (e.g. errors).
# The recommended practice is to install PyTorch from the official website to match the hardware first.
# To work on graphs, install torch-geometric following the official instructions at https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric#installation
